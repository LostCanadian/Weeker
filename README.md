# Weeker

Weeker is a weekly planning app built with React and TypeScript.

## Core concepts

Weeker helps you define focus areas for the week, set the time you intend to
invest in each, and track progress. A focus area is considered **achieved** once
its logged time meets or exceeds the target you set. When that happens, the UI
encourages you to reduce attention on the achieved item and redirect your effort
elsewhere.

Key capabilities include:

- Add new focus cards with a name and target number of hours.
- Track invested time with quick increment controls or a slider.
- Reset the week to clear logged time while keeping your focus areas intact.
- Remove focus cards you no longer want to track.
- Review a weekly summary of targets, time invested, and achieved areas.

necessary proxy or mirror before installing dependencies.

Run the development server:
