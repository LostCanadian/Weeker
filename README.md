# Weeker

Weeker is a weekly planning app built with React and TypeScript.

## Core concepts

Start each week with a fresh perspective on the priorities that really matter, 
without being encumbered by an ever-growing list of to-do items. Weeker helps 
you define focus areas for the week, set the time you intend to invest in each, 
and track progress. A focus area is considered **achieved** once its logged 
time meets or exceeds the target you set.

Key capabilities include:

- Add new focus cards with a name and target number of hours.
- Track invested time with quick increment controls.
- Review a weekly summary of targets, time invested, and achieved areas.
- Monitor progress to see how things are tracking.

## Use cases

- Personal projects
- Fitness goals
- Work-life balance
- Sleep tracking
